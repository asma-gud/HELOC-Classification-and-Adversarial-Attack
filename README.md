This repository contains the classification of heloc dataset, alongside an application of the Papernot adversarial attack on a Random Forest model. The project is structured into two main parts:
Part 1: HELOC Dataset Classification using a Random Forest model then with a simple DNN classifier
Part 2: Adversarial Attack Implementation
