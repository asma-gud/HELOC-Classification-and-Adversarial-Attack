# HELOC-Classification-and-Adversarial-Attack
This repository aims for classifying the HELOC dataset using a Random Forest model and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). It also implements the Papernot adversarial attack on the Random Forest model to generate adversarial examples and evaluates its accuracy against these examples.
